RFC822
======

Presently, the sole purpose of this gem is to parse and validate email
addresses according to the spec (except where it makes most sense to
deviate).

USAGE
=====

To parse and validate a single email address, use RFC822::Address.build

  require "rfc822"
  email = RFC822::Address.build("john+nospam@example.com")
  email.address # => "john+nospam@example.com"
  email.valid? # => true

Display names in email addresses are also fully supported:

  email = RFC822::Address.build('"John Doe, III" <john@example.com>')
  email.name # => "John Doe, III"
  email.to_s # => "\"John Doe, III\" <john@example.com>"

To parse and validate a list of email addresses, use RFC822::Address.parse.
Addresses can be separated by commas or newlines.

  emails = RFC822::Address.parse("john@example.com, jane@example.com")
  emails.size # => 2
  emails[1].address # => "jane@example.com"
